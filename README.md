# Connect 4 Project
This is a Connect 4 game. It involves two players. The object of the game is to connect four pieces of the same color. 
The pieces can be connected diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.
You can thwart your opponent by preventing them from connecting four pieces.
If you and your opponent fill the board before connecting four pieces of the same color, a tie is called. 

This project displays my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including ES2015) skills.
